LeetCode solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various **LeetCode** problems, written in **Python** and **JavaScript**.  

Python solutions:

-Focused on algorithmic problem-solving and data structures.
-Mainly used for practicing logic, problem analysis, and writing clean code.

JavaScript solutions:

This section contains my progress through the **LeetCode 30 Days of JavaScript** (https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-javascript/) challenge.


The main goal is:
 **Practice** python through algorithm and data structure problems.
**Learn** javascript fundamentals with the **30 Days of JavaScript** challenge
**Build** a consistent, mostly daily routine for coding practice and apply these abilities to my cybersecurity development.


**Note:** 
All solutions are written from my own understanding, so in some question folders you might find images or pseudocode that i created before solving the problem because i want to understand the logic by myself.

Only solutions are shared here, problem statements belong to LeetCode.
